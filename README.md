Repo for practice code from Coursera coursework

Courses are as follows:

* _GetCleanData_: Getting and Cleaning Data, offered by Johns Hopkins University. I did not pay to unlock the course, and have my assignments graded, but code to take the quizzes and responses are recorded within.
* _ML_: Machine Learning, offered by Stanford University. Programming assignments are completed in both Octave (for compatibility with course grader), and in Python.
* _PyDatabases_: Using Databases with Python, offered by the University of Michigan. Assignments completed with MySQL instead of SQLite.
